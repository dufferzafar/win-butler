You can change the path if you want to.\r\n\r\n  * **Printscreen** : Save the entire screen.\r\n  * **Shift + Printscreen** : Save the screen, upload to imgur and copy the URL to clipboard like a boss!\r\n  * **Ctrl + Printscreen** : Save the screen but not the taskbar portion.\r\n  * **Alt + Printscreen** : Save the active window.\r\n\r\n* **Alt + Ctrl + C** : Launch Console in the current directory.\r\n\r\n  Launches to root \"C:\\\" if path cannot be grabbed.\r\n\r\n* **Windows + Space** : Launch Scriptlet Library\r\n\r\n  Take quick notes. Press Windows + Space again to save and exit.\r\n\r\n  Useful to save random chunks of code/text or whatever.\r\n\r\n  Scriptlets can be executed, saved to file or copied to clipboard.\r\n\r\n* **Alt + Ctrl + D** : Select a phrase and then press the hotkey to find words similar to it via the OneLook Reverse Dictionary.\r\n\r\n* **Alt + Ctrl + S** : Save selected text\r\n\r\n  Select some text and press Alt+Ctrl+S, give a filename and it'll be saved to desktop. When no extension is provided, the deafult i.e txt will be used.\r\n\r\n* **Alt + Shift + S** : Save selected text as AHK and execute the Script\r\n\r\n* **Ctrl + Shift + S** : Works in *Sublime text*, Press it to launch the currently open file. PHP files are opened by the path from localhost.\r\n\r\n* **Ctrl + Shift + Esc** : Launch Task manager\r\n\r\n  This hotkey first removes any sort of restriction placed (like \"Taskmanager has been disabled by your administrator\").\r\n\r\n* **Alt + Ctrl + R** : Launch Registry Editor\r\n\r\n  Select a registry key like \"HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\Python.File\\shell\\open\" and then Press the hotkey to directly jump to that Key. Sweet, ain't it?\r\n\r\n  Similar to task manager, any restriction on registry editor is removed.\r\n\r\n* In a Command prompt window\r\n\r\n  * **Ctrl + V**: It is not possible to paste data directly to a command prompt window. Not anymore.\r\n\r\n  * **Ctrl + W**: Close the console.\r\n\r\n* Launch CHM Help files...\r\n\r\n  You'll have to tweak the script to provide paths to your help files.\r\n\r\n  * **Ctrl + Shift + Q** : Launch Python's help file.\r\n  * **Ctrl + Shift + A** : Launch Autohotkey's help file.\r\n  * **Ctrl + Shift + Z** : Launch Help Folder\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"todo\"></a>To Do ASAP\r\n\r\n* Backup Buddy Module\r\n  * Animated TrayIcon\r\n\r\n* Settings GUI\r\n  * Hotkeys - Bindings, On/Off\r\n  * Folder Paths\r\n  * Backup Settings\r\n\r\n* TrayMenu\r\n  * Turn Backup Buddy On/Off\r\n\r\n* RunFromSublime\r\n  * Untitled Files\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"later\"></a>Could be added later\r\n\r\n* Volume Control\r\n  * Mute\r\n\r\n* Core Sorting Hat Module\r\n\r\n* Screenshots\r\n  * Upload Prompt ??\r\n  * Imgur User Account\r\n  * Authorization Headers\r\n\r\n* Goo.gl URL Shortner\r\n  * OnClipboardChange ?\r\n  * On Ctrl+V if IsURL()\r\n  * Authorization Headers\r\n\r\n* Global Ctrl + W\r\n  * WhiteList/BlackList\r\n  * Maps to Alt+F4\r\n  * But in some applications to Ctrl+W\r\n\r\n* Copy selected File/Folder's path.\r\n\r\n* A launcher for some tasks\r\n  * Radial Menu or Sublime like command pallette ?\r\n  * Select text and then play with it: Google, Wiki, WikiQuotes, OneLook.\r\n  * Detect whether the text is url, if so, open it.\r\n  * If the text is larger than 7 words show a save to file action rather than One Look.\r\n\r\n* Add other scripts:\r\n  * Renamer\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"changelog\"></a>Changelog\r\n\r\n* **2.3**:\r\n\r\n  Added: An About Gui. yay!\r\n  Added: TrayMenu Icons for changing the screenshot size.\r\n  Added: TrayIcon for when the script is suspended. \r\n\r\n* **2.1**:\r\n\r\n  Added: Volume Control (On Screen Display).
